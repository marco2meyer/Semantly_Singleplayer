### How to Play
Your goal is to guess the secret word.

**How It Works:**
- Each guess you make will receive a score showing how close it is to the secret word. 
- The score is shown as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the closer your guess is to the secret word.
- Use the hints to guide your guesses.

**Good Luck!**
